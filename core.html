<h1>Core Characteristics</h1>

<section class="normative">
    <h2>Method Name</h2>

    <p>The method name that identifies this DID method SHALL be: <code>peer</code></p>
    <p>A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix: <code>did:peer:</code>.
        Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after the prefix,
        is the <dfn>method specific identifier</dfn> (<dfn>MSI</dfn>) described <a href="#method-specific-identifier">below</a>.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="normative">
    <h2>Target System(s)</h2>

    <p>This DID method applies to any identity management implementation that meets the following two
        requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Generation Algorithm</em> &mdash; The DIDs are created using the <a href="#method-specific-identifier">
            algorithm described below</a>, endowing them with properties vital to trust between peers without
            incurring a dependency on a central source of truth.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Protocol</em> &mdash; The metadata for DIDs (what would be stored in an on-chain DID doc in other methods)
            is communicated and maintained as described in the <a href="#protocols">Protocols</a> section. (This
            requirement may be partly irrelevant if support for peer DIDs targets static DID docs only. See
            <a href="#layers-of-support">Layers of Support</a>.)
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="normative">
    <h2>Method Specific Identifier</h2>

    <p>The peer DID scheme is defined by the following ABNF (see [[RFC5234]] for syntax):</p>
    <pre class="example" class="ABNF" title="ABNF for peer DIDs">
peer-did = "did:peer:" numalgo transform encnumbasis
numalgo = "0" / "1"
transform = "z"
encnumbasis = 46*BASE58BTC
    </pre>
    <p>Peer DIDs use an underlying number with high entropy, called the <dfn>numeric basis</dfn>, as the source of their
        uniqueness. There are two methods for generating this number, as described in the <a href="#generation-method">
        next section</a> of this spec. These methods are represented in the DID value with <code>numalgo
        </code> == <code>0</code> or <code>numalgo</code> == <code>1</code>.
    </p>
    <p>To build the full MSI, the raw bytes of the <em>numeric basis</em> are prefixed with a <a target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec"><dfn>multicodec descriptor</dfn></a> that makes those bytes
        self-describing. This descriptor plus the raw bytes are then transformed to text in the manner associated with
        <code>transform</code>. This yields <code>encnumbasis</code> in the ABNF.
    </p>

    <figure id="composition">
        <img src="composition.png" alt="composition of a peer DID value"/>
        <figcaption>Composition of a peer DID value</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>In this version of the spec, the <a>multicodec descriptor</a> for <code>numalgo</code> == <code>0</code> is
        dependent on key type and exactly matches the descriptor that would be used for the same value in <code>did:key</code>.
        The <a>multicodec descriptor</a> for <code>numalgo</code> == <code>1</code> is byte pair <code>0x12 0x20</code>, which says
        that what follows is a SHA2-256 hash, 32 bytes long. (The size is included because, although SHA-256 is known
        to produce 32-byte digests, other hash algorithms have variable-length output, and we could change the hash
        algorithm in a future version of the spec.) The <code>transform</code> is
        base58, represented by the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://github.com/multiformats/multibase/blob/master/README.md">multibase prefix</a> <code>z</code>.
        <code>BASE58BTC</code> in the ABNF means the <a target="_blank"
        href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding#Base58_symbol_chart">Bitcoin base58 character inventory</a>;
        for brevity, we omit the expansion--but see the <a href="#matching-regex">matching regex</a> for details.
    </p>
    <p>The format of the DID value is intended to be future-proof, offering three expandable self-describing choices.
        Future versions of the spec may describe additional methods of generating the numeric basis; each new method
        should be associated with the next unused <code>numalgo</code> decimal digit when it is defined. Likewise,
        future versions of the spec may choose a different way to transform raw bytes to text, or a different format
        for the raw bytes of the <a>numeric basis</a>; these should be reflected in updated values of <code>transform</code>
        or of the <a>multicodec descriptor</a> at the front of the transformed bytes, respectively.
    </p>
    <p class="note">Base58 is case-sensitive; in this version of the spec, peer DIDs MUST be compared with a
        case-sensitive algorithm and MUST NOT be normalized in case. The more general rule is that case sensitivity
        derives from <code>transform</code>, so routines that process multiple versions of peer DIDs MUST derive their
        case sensitivity rules from the corresponding properties of whatever <code>transform</code> a particular peer
        DID uses.</p>

<section class="normative">
    <h2>Generation Method</h2>

    <p>The unique <em>numeric basis</em> underlying a Peer DID MUST be generated in one of the following two ways:</p>

    <h3>Method 0: inception key without doc</h3>
    <p>If <code>numalgo</code> == <code>0</code>, a single keypair is chosen, having all possible privileges with respect
        to the DID. The public key value for this pair is the numeric basis of the DID. The genesis version of the DID
        doc is considered to be empty, granting all privileges to this key (and algorithmic derivations thereof, to
        provide key agreement versus signing and so forth). The DID doc offers no endpoint. This makes the DID
        functionally equivalent to a did:key value, and visually similar, except that a peer DID will have the numeric
        algorithm as a prefix, before the multibase encoded, multicodec-encoded public key. For example, <code>did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH</code> is equivalent to <code>did:peer:<span style="color:blue">0</span>z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH</code>. The did:peer version differs
        in that it is upgradeable to a dynamically updatable DID with full DID doc and endpoints, simply using deltas,
        as long as the first delta is authenticated by the inception key.
    </p>

    <h3>Method 1: genesis doc</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a <dfn>genesis version</dfn> of JSON text of the DID doc for the DID. The genesis version MUST define
            a single key with the <a>register</a> privilege. This <dfn>inception key</dfn> is the key that creates the
            DID and authenticates when exchanging it with the first peer. It SHOULD also include enough state that
            subsequent evolutions to the doc are authorized; otherwise, the doc is static, suitable only for
            <a href="#layers-of-support">Layer 2 use</a>. It MUST NOT include the
            DID itself (either the root <code>id</code> property or its value). This lets the doc be created without
            knowing the DID's value in advance. Suppressing the DID value creates a <dfn>stored variant</dfn> of peer
            DID doc data, as opposed to the <dfn>resolved variant</dfn> that would have an actual DID value in the root
            <code>id</code> property. (In either the stored or resolved variant of the doc, anywhere else that the DID
            value would appear, it should appear as a relative reference rather than an absolute value. For example,
            each<code>controller</code> property of a <a href="#publickey">publicKey that is owned by this DID would say
                <code>"controller": "#id"</code></a>.)
        </li>
        <li>Calculate the SHA256 [[!RFC4634]] hash of the bytes of the <a>stored variant</a> of the <a>genesis
            version</a> of the DID doc, and make this value the new DID's <a>numeric basis</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>By hashing the stored variant, we avoid the circular problem of including the DID in the data that's being
        hashed. This means that a peer DID doc must be resolved by converting a <a>stored variant</a> of DID doc
        data into a <a>resolved variant</a> by inserting the value of the DID being resolved.</p>
    <p>By deriving the numeric basis of the DID from the <a>genesis version</a> of the DID doc, the DID can begin its
        lifecycle with any number of keys and endpoints, including protective M-of-N policies. The <a>inception key</a>
        is the part of the genesis state that's true bedrock; all other information is optional and can be thought of
        as a sort of <em>pre-rotation</em> or<em>pre-evolution</em>, initiated by the inception key, to a more complex
        state.
    </p>
    <p>
        The root of trust for peer DIDs is the entropy in the <a>inception key</a>. The inception key MUST be new for
        each DID; it MUST NOT ever be reused--and it must be the case that anyone observing the public half of the
        inception key cannot somehow derive or steal the private half. This guarantees that nobody other than the holder
        of the inception key could have created the genesis version of the DID doc. Because only the inception key has
        the privilege of sharing the DID doc with a peer, no other key holder can establish the relationship contrary to
        the intent of the inception key holder. This gives peer DIDs a <dfn>self-certifying</dfn> property that is vital
        to cybersecurity of all DIDs. Any DID method that does not guarantee the chain of custody of the DID between
        when it is created and when it is shared (e.g., written to a ledger or given to a peer) lacks this quality and
        is susceptible to attacks early in the DID's lifecycle. See <a target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/openssi/peer-did-method-spec/issues/112">this github issue</a> for more discussion.

    <h2>Recognizing and handling peer DIDs</h2>

    <p>Correctly recognizing and handling peer DIDs as strings is a <a>Layer 1</a> feature.
        A valid <code>peer</code> DID might be:</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A typical peer DID" id="typical-did">
did:peer:1zQmZMygzYqNwU6Uhmewx5Xepf2VLp5S4HLSwwgf2aiKZuwa
    </pre>

    <p>Peer DIDs consist entirely of printable ASCII characters and in this version of the spec are exactly 57
        characters long. They have no whitespace, and the only punctuation they use is the <code>:</code> character. When
        rendering in columns with a constrained width, they could be hyphenated one or more times as needed; the hyphens
        would not be confused with meaningful delimiters, and the final character of the DID would be easy to find.
        They could also be rendered in a short form with the middle of the long base58 section elided, if it is not
        necessary to compare them with precision: <code>did:peer:1z6Tx...WzJJq</code>. The ellipsis should not obscure
        the prefix or the initial or final few characters of <code>encnumbasis</code>, to preserve enough info for
        casual distinction. This might be a useful rendering in log files, for example.
    </p>

    <p>A convenient regex to match <code>peer</code> DIDs is:</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Matching regex" id="matching-regex">
^did:peer:[01](z)([1-9a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z]{46,47})$)$
    </pre>

    <p>A match against this regex places <code>numalgo</code> (the algorithm for choosing a numeric basis) in
        capture group 1, <code>transform</code> in capture group 2, and <code>encnumbasis</code> in capture group 3.
    </p>

    <p>Note that peer DIDs can also be used in DID URIs, with query parameters. Currently, the only query parameter formally defined for peer DIDs is <code>initial-state</code>, discussed <a target="#initial-state">below</a>. However, support for `hl` and `version-id` will be specified soon,
        and other parameters may be used by a given implementation, so recipients of a peer DID URI should at least be prepared to parse the DID into its base DID value and its query string portion (which begins with the <code>?</code> character. All query parameter values in peer DID URIs are base64url encoded without padding (consistent with JOSE conventions).</p>

    <p>A few peer DID values are reserved and convey special meaning. See <a href="#reserved-values">Reserved Values</a>
        in the appendix.
