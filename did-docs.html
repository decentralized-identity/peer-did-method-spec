<h1>DID docs</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Backing Storage</h2>

    <p>At first glance, it might seem that parties dealing in peer DID docs could just store raw DID docs.
        However, this is only a viable answer for the lower 2 <a href="#layers-of-support">layers of support</a>
        for peer DIDs. Any time a DID doc evolves, proof that the evolution is authorized must be found
        in the DID doc's previous state. If an agent is offline for an extended period (e.g., a phone is lost in the
        couch cushions for a week), multiple evolutions may have occurred by the time it reconnects--and it cannot
        accept the latest state of the doc without validating the sequence of changes it underwent to get there. Agents
        must be able to prove to one another that the state they hold is correct, and they must be able to answer
        questions about <em>what</em> the state used to be, and <em>who</em> authorized <em>which</em> changes, <em>when
        </em>.
    </p>
    <p>This means that updatable peer DID docs need to be associated with some type of <dfn>backing storage</dfn> that
        adds metadata and history to the simple content of the docs themselves.
    </p>
    <p>The backing storage for updatable peer DID docs is therefore a sequence of <dfn>deltas</dfn>. Each delta is
        a JSON object in this form:</p>
    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Delta structure">
{
    "change": &lt;base64url encoding of a change fragment&gt;,
    "by": [ {"key": &lt;id of key&gt;, "sig": &lt;signature value&gt;} ... ],
    "when": &lt;ISO8601/RFC3339 UTC timestamp with at least second precision&gt;
}
    </pre>
    <p>Here, a <dfn>change fragment</dfn> is a sparse version of a DID doc that shows just the section being
        updated. The <code>by</code> property contains one or more key+signature pairs over the raw (non-base64url-encoded)
        JSON text of the change fragment, and <code>when</code> contains a value supplied by the system clock. This
        value is like timestamps on an email header&mdash;not guaranteed to be highly accurate, but useful for rough
        analysis.
    </p>
    <p>Deltas are uniquely identified by the SHA256 hash of the raw (non-base64url-encoded) bytes of their change fragment,
        and so are the change fragments themselves. Two change fragments with the same semantic meaning but different
        indents or different attribute orders are considered different changes. This is because peer DIDs entirely
        ignore the thorny problem of JSON canonicalization. The raw bytes of change fragments are normative and MUST
        NOT be altered.
    </p>
    <p>Comparisons of state between any two versions of a peer DID doc look at the raw bytes of all known
        change fragments, beginning with the stored variant of the genesis doc. Instead of testing the semantic
        equivalence of data structures built from DID docs, or comparing the resolved variants of DID Docs, they ask:
        "Do both parties know about the same changes?" If yes, then peer DID docs are considered equivalent, regardless
        of formatting differences.
    </p>
    <p>Deltas are like database transactions, in that they may embody multiple changes that must be performed together.
        For example, key rotation involves both a key addition and a key deletion, performed as a unit.
        All changes in a single delta MUST share a common authorization; it is invalid to combine into one delta changes
        requiring two different authorizations, as this makes authorization of each individual change ambiguous.
    </p>
    <p>A resolved peer DID doc at any given point in time is a view or projection of the cumulative effect of all
        known deltas up to that point, with resolution adding the DID value itself to the composite <a>stored
        variant</a> of DID doc data.
    </p>
    <p class="note">Early explorations of this DID method used the term <dfn>microledger</dfn> for backing storage. This
        term has some resonance, in that backing storage is an append-only record of immutable transactions. However,
        ledger technology requires strong ordering, whereas our ordering requirements are somewhat relaxed. What we need
        is closer to the approach of <a target="_blank" href="https://opentransactions.org/wiki/Triple-Signed_Receipts">
            triple-signed receipts</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143">KERI</a>, not to a
        ledger or blockchain maintained by pure consensus. Thus, we have chosen not to emphasize the term here, because
        it may feel intimidating to some, and because the actual storage mechanism in an implementation of this method
        could be a simple file, a database, or anything else that provides suitable features.
    </p>
    <p>In the discussion about generating a <a>numeric basis</a> for a peer DID, the <a>genesis version</a> of a peer
        DID doc was defined. The genesis version is the one associated with the first delta committed to backing
        storage. In the first delta, <code>change</code> contains the genesis state of the doc, <code>by</code> holds
        a signature from any key defined internally in the genesis state, and <code>when</code> is populated by the
        system clock.
    </p>
    <p class="note">The genesis state MUST only be accepted by a peer if it is properly authenticated. This cannot be
        done by signing the DID doc, since such a signature doesn't bind the signer to the intention to share in any
        given context. Instead, the holder of the <a>inception key</a> must either sign a nonce that's
        bound to the sharing context, or must place authenticated encryption around the message that transmits the
        document to the peer. This proves that the creator of the DID intended to register it with the peer, and has
        not been shadowed by a malicious man-in-the-middle.

    <h2>CRDTs</h2>

    <p>Because peer DID docs can be updated by multiple parties at the same time (as when two agents of the same
        identity owner rotate their keys without coordinating), they have the potential for merge conflicts. Resolving
        these merge conflicts could introduce much complexity in our DID method. However, peer DID docs use a clever
        technique that avoids much of the pain. The backing storage for peer DID docs is carefully defined to
        be a <a target="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">conflict-free
        replicated data type</a> (<dfn>CRDT</dfn>).
    </p>
    <p>CRDTs are a deep subject unto themselves, with a body of academic research; additional study is recommended.
        They are behind familiar experiences like simultaneous, distributed editing of Google Docs, which never raises
        error messages about merge conflicts. Here, we will not explain their theory; we will simply note some key
        requirements that they impose on DID docs and their <a>backing storage</a>. More details are given later in
        this spec, where individual parts of the DID doc are described. The general rules are:
    </p>

    <ol id="crdt-rules">
        <li>Core building blocks&mdash;keys, rules, and service endpoints&mdash;must be assigned
            <code>id</code> properties that are unique within the DID doc, across all its versions.</li>
        <li>All items with <code>id</code> properties must be immutable. They can be deleted, but they can never have
            a different state than they were created with. The effect of modifying an item can be achieved by
            deleting an old item and replacing it with a new item that has a different <code>id</code> and updated
            properties.</li>
        <li>Deleting an item is accomplished by adding its <code>id</code> to a <dfn>deletion list</dfn>. This list
            is a root property of the <a>stored variant</a> of a DID doc and is named <code>deleted</code>. It is
            suppressed when generating a <a>resolved variant</a> of the DID doc, so it is only visible in the deltas
            of <a>backing storage</a>. See <a href="#deleting-a-verificationMethod">this clarifying example</a>.</li>
        <li>When any party encounters two versions of a peer DID doc that are mututally incompatible, an impartial,
            ungameable resolution algorithm is used to restore harmony. See <a href="#conflict-resolution">Conflict
            Resolution</a> in the appendix for details.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><code>initialState</code></h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes it is useful (or even required) to communicate a doc-capable peer DID value
        (one with <code>numalgo</code> != 0) and its genesis or evolved DID doc as a single
        combined value, instead of sharing the DID as one piece of data, and its DID doc and
        deltas as another. This situation commonly occurs in connection protocols that are
        built on <a target="_blank" href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/docs/spec/">
        DIDComm messaging</a>, for example: <var>A</var> wants to share with <var>B</var> the new
        pairwise DID they've allocated (A.did@A:B), plus the DID's full DID doc (A.diddoc@A:B),
        and DIDComm requires all information about the sender to be passed in a single
        <code>from</code> field.
    </p>
    <p>
        The way to do this is to use the <code>initialState</code> query parameter of a peer
        DID URL. All implementations of peer DIDs are required to recognize the meaning of this
        query parameter, though only implementations that support deltas (layer 2 or 3) need to
        process it. The parameter value can be extracted from a peer DID URL with the following
        regex:
    </p>
    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Regex to extract initialState" id="initial-state-regex">
^did:peer:[^0].+[?](.*&)?initialState=([^&]*)(?:&|$)
    </pre>
    <p>
        This places the value of the <code>initialState</code> parameter in capture group 1.
    </p>
    <p>To interpret the parameter value, it must first be base64url (minus padding) decoded. The
        result MUST be a JSON array containing zero or more deltas. An empty parameter value is
        also allowed, and is considered equivalent to an empty JSON array.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2><code><dfn>verificationMethod</dfn></code></h2>

    <p>The <code>verificationMethod</code> section of a peer DID document, in either stored or resolved form, is as you would
        expect from a reading of the <a target="didspec" href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#authentication">DID
        spec</a>. Peer DID docs MUST define all of their internal and external keys in this section; although the DID
        spec permits inline definitions in the <code>authentication</code> and <code>authorization</code> sections of a
        DID doc, this DID method disallows that option to simplify the possible permutations of a <a>change fragment</a>.
    </p>
    <p>All <code>id</code> properties associated with a key defined internally in the DID doc MUST be in
        relative, not absolute form (that is, "#xyz" instead of "did:peer:abc#xyz"). IDs for keys defined
        interally may be generated in either of these two ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The first 8 characters of the key's unique representation may be used as the <code>id</code>, if this
            provides enough uniqueness within the document. (Global uniqueness is irrelevant.) For example, if the
            key is defined with a <code>publicKeyBase58</code> property value that begins with <code>H3C2AVvL</code>,
            then its <code>id</code> would be <code>H3C2AVvL</code>; a key with a <code>publicKeyHex</code> property
            that begins with <code>02b97c30</code> would have an <code>id</code> of <code>02b97c30</code>, and a key
            with a <code>publicKeyPem</code> property that begins, after its <code>-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY</code>
            delimiter, with the value <code>izfrNTmQ</code>, would have an <code>id</code> of <code>izfrNTmQ</code>.
        </li>
        <li>A standard 128-bit UUID of type 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (see [[RFC4122]]), rendered with hyphens and in lower
            case, may be used as the<code>id</code> instead.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">All IDs in DID docs, including these, should be considered case-sensitive. Ignoring case will result
        in invalid comparisons for key <code>id</code>s based on encodings that are not hex.
    </p>
    <p>Because peer DIDs usually operate independent of global registries, external references (where <code>controller</code>
        is not <code>#id</code>) will probably be rare, with the possible exception of <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0046-mediators-and-relays/README.md">
            mediator</a> keys that have the <a>route</a> privilege.
    </p>

    <pre class="example" title="A verificationMethod section">
{
  ...
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "id": "H3C2AVvL",
      "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",

    </pre>

    <p class="note">This DID method is relatively agnostic with respect to key types. However, elliptic curve
        keys (Ed25519, Secp256, etc) are recommended because the keys are smaller, the number
        of bits of security are greater, and the computations more efficient, than RSA key types.

        <h3 id="adding-a-verificationMethod">Adding a key</h3>

        <p>To add a new key with <code>id</code> = <code>Mv6gmMNa</code> to a peer DID doc, you might create
        a <a>change fragment</a> of the DID doc that looks like this:
        </p>

        <pre class="example" title="Change fragment that adds a new key">
{
    "verificationMethod": [
        {
          "id": "Mv6gmMNa",
          "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
          "controller": "#id",
          "publicKeyMultibase": "zMv6gmMNam3uVAjH3C2AVvLZZn6z3wXmqPVpfkcJCwDwn"
        }
    ],
    "authorization": { "profiles": [ {"key": "#Mv6gmMNa", "roles": ["edge"]} ] }
}
        </pre>

        <p>Change fragments only show where something is <em>appended</em> to either normal lists or the <a>deletion
            list</a>. Here, the single entries under <code>verificationMethod</code> and <code>authorization.profiles</code> are
            additions, not replacements, to the lists that already contain values. (The <a>trust profile</a> embodied in
            the <code>authorization.profiles</code> associates the new key with privileges. This must be done at creation
            time. It is discussed under <a href="#authorization"><code>authorization</code></a>.) The <a>delta</a> that
            encapsulates this update would take the above JSON text, base64url-encode it, and assign the result to the
            delta's <code>change</code> property. It would need to be authorized by a key with the <a>key_admin</a>
            privilege, evidenced in the delta's <code>by</code> field. The resulting delta might look like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Delta that adds a new key">
{

    <section>
        <h3 id="deleting-a-verificationMethod">Deleting a key</h3>

        <p>Any key can be deleted by appending its <code>id</code> to the <code>deleted</code> list at the root of
            the <a>stored variant</a> of a peer DID doc, and by removing its corresponding entry from the <code>verificationMethod</code>
            section. Only the append-to-<code>deleted</code> operation needs to be represented in the <a>change
            fragment</a>; the corresponding removal from the <code>verificationMethod</code> section is implied. For example, to
            delete a key with <code>id</code> = <code>izfrNTmQ</code>, your <a>change fragment</a> would look like
            this:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Change fragment that deletes a key with id=izfrNTmQ">
{
    "deleted": [ "izfrNTmQ" ]
}
        </pre>
        <p>This fragment would be base64url-encoded and signed in a corresponding delta, in much the same way that
        the fragment was handled in the example about adding a key.</p>

<section>
    <h2><code><dfn>authentication</dfn></code></h2>
    <p>The <code>authentication</code> section of a peer DID document conforms to <a target="didspec"
            href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#authentication">standard practice described in the DID spec</a>,
        with the constraint that only references, not inline key definitions, are allowed. Any keys referenced
        here may be used to authenticate or login as the DID.
    </p>
    <p>However, the meaning of "authenticate" or "login" deserves comment, because there is a tendency in DID
        circles to reference too many keys in this section, and because heavy use of this section is discouraged
        with peer DIDs.
    </p>
    <p>A <dfn>sovereign domain</dfn> (the scope of things under the control of a single, sovereign identity owner) may
        include keys that represent the identity owner with greater or lesser degrees of trust. For example, the
        identity owner may hold one key on paper, locked in a safe; she may hold another key on a mobile device's
        secure enclave, protected by a biometric; she may hold a third key on a server in a config file protected
        only by an ACL. These keys may all be legitimate evidence that the DID subject is interacting, but
        they are not equally strong evidence. Only the strongest forms of evidence should be accepted as a
        basis for authentication when stakes are high.</p>
    <p>This is not unlike what happens on the political landscape. A low-level diplomat and the president / premier
        / prime minister of a nation are both authentic representatives of their people&mdash;but the scope of their
        privileges, and the concomitant trust, are different. Only the highest-level officials should be signing
        binding international treaties.
    </p>
    <p>The <a href="#authorization"><code>authorization</code> section</a> of peer DID docs, described next, is
        where fine-grained privileges are described. The <code>authentication</code> section is a blunt instrument,
        incapable of distinguishing between these levels of trust, and incapable of associating trust with anything
        more complex than a single key. It is supported for historical reasons, and because most so-called "DID
        Authentication" use cases assume it will be populated. With peer DIDs, the strong recommendation is that
        only keys held by the most trusted proxies should be referenced here&mdash;only list the equivalent of your
        president / premier / prime minister keys in this section, not the equivalent of keys for your low-level
        diplomats. This will prevent impersonation by less trusted keys when stakes are high.
    </p>
    <section>
        <h3 id="adding-key-to-authn">Adding a key</h3>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, all objects having an <code>id</code> property in peer DID docs are immutable. This
            means that a key cannot change its status with respect to the <code>authentication</code> section of a peer
            DID doc during its lifetime in that doc; it must be declared as an authentication key when it is first
            defined. A <a>change fragment</a> for adding an internally defined key and giving it status in the

    <h2><code><dfn>authorization</dfn></code></h2>

    <p class="note">This section of a peer DID docs governs how DID docs are updated and DIDComm trust flows. It doesn't
        contemplate custom authorization schemes such as peers might develop to give each other spending limits or
        access to sensitive data. Those matters are better formalized with something like a verifiable credential, or a
        simple digitally signed permission slip.
    </p>

    <p>Peer DID docs organize their <code>authorization</code> section into two lists. The first, <code>profiles
    </code>, gives a <dfn>trust profile</dfn> for each key, as expressed by named roles the key holds. These
        named roles are arbitrary strings chosen by the implementer; since they are only used to match against
        rules in the second list, their meaning in normal language does not need to be understood by a party
        wishing to support correct semantics.
    </p>
    <p class="note">Changes to the <code>profiles</code> list MUST be performed when a key is added or deleted;
    the <a>trust profile</a> of a key cannot change after it is created.</p>
    <p>The second list contains <a href="https://evernym.github.io/sgl" target="sgl">SGL</a> rules that grant
        privileges according to named roles. Here is an example:
    </p>

        {"key": "#02b97c30", "roles", ["cloud"]},             // a "cloud" key

        <li>Let a key have the <a>route</a> and <a>authcrypt</a> privileges when its set of roles contains "cloud".</li>
        <li>Let a key have the <a>authcrypt</a>, <a>plaintext</a> and <a>sign</a> privileges when its set of roles
            contains "edge".</li>
        <li>Let any 2 keys, acting together, have the <a>key_admin</a>, <a>se_admin</a>, and <a>rule_admin</a>
            privileges when their roles each contain either "offline" or "biometric".</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Privilege Inventory</h3>

        <p>Unlike role names, the privileges named in these rules DO need to be understood by code that parses peer
            DID docs; it is these privileges that others in a relationship should enforce. Possible values include:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><dfn>register</dfn></dt>
            <dd>The holder of this privilege is allowed to register the DID as an identifier with another party. Exactly
                one key MUST hold this privilege in the genesis version of the DID doc. This <a>inception key</a> creates
                the DID and takes custody of it at least until it can be exchanged with a peer. This key MUST authenticate
                with the peer during DID exchange; any other authentication MUST be rejected as it may represent a
                different, otherwise-authorized key trying to exchange the DID in ways that diverge from its creator's
                intentions. After the DID has been registered once, no key SHOULD hold this privilege unless/until it is
                registered again (e.g., in upgrading <a>pairwise</a> to <a>n-wise</a>).
            </dd>

            <dt><dfn>route</dfn></dt>
            <dd>The holder of this privilege is allowed to receive and decrypt <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0094-cross-domain-messaging#required-mediators-process-forward-messages">
                DIDComm <code>forward</code> messages</a> encrypted for itself, and to forward the contained
                <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0019-encryption-envelope/README.md"
                target="aries">DIDComm encryption envelope</a> to another key. Holders of these keys thus become aware
                of the timing and size of some incoming messages for the recipient (though not of the messages' senders
                or content). This privilege is required and appropriate for any cloud agent or <a target="aries"

                firewall.</dd>

            <dt><dfn>authcrypt</dfn></dt>
            <dd>The holder of this privilege is allowed to create messages and send them with <a target="wikipedia"
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption">authenticated encryption</a>
                that reveals the identity associated with this DID to the reciever. Most agents are likely to have this
                privilege, but one designed for passive reception only (e.g., on an IoT sensor) might have it removed;
                doing so would prevent a hacker from co-opting such a key into sending in a trusted way. Messages that
                are authcrypted by a key that lacks this privilege SHOULD be rejected as unauthorized.</dd>

            <dt><dfn>plaintext</dfn></dt>
            <dd>The holder of this privilege can see <a target="aries"
                    href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0044-didcomm-file-and-mime-types#didcomm-messages-dm">

            </a>. External parties sending to the owner of a given DIDDoc should multiplex encrypt for all keys that
                hold this privilege, except in special circumstances.</dd>

            <dt><dfn>sign</dfn></dt>
            <dd><p>The holder of this privilege can incur non-repudiable contractual obligations on behalf of the DID subject.
                This may actually be a better test for login or authentication, in many cases, than whether a key appears
                in the <a href="#authentication"><code>authentication</code> section</a> of the DID doc; it depends on
                what trust is imputed after login.</p>
                <p class="note">Any key holder can sign a DIDComm message; doing so gives non-repudiation to the
                    message. However, remember our <a href="#authentication">earlier discussion</a> about low-level
                    diplomats versus the president or prime minister of a country&mdash;both are authentic officials,
                    but only the president or prime minister's signature is binding on an international treaty. This
                    privilege makes explicit that sort of special binding-the-owner status; any other signatures
                    serve to prove origin with a specific agent but not the endorsement of the DID subject.
                </p></dd>

            <dt><dfn>key_admin</dfn></dt>
            <dd>The holder of this privilege can add or remove other keys from a peer DID doc's <a href="#verificationMethod">
                <code>verificationMethod</code> section</a>, <a href="#authentication"><code>authentication</code> section</a>,
                or <code>authorization.profiles</code> list. Typically this privilege is held only by very privileged
                keys, or by combinations of keys, to prevent hackers who co-opt one device from adding new, malicious
                keys to the inventory.
                To guard against privilege escalation, it is important to enforce that entity
                adding the new key can only add grant privileges (add <code>roles</code>) that it itself has.
                Also note that a key can remove itself from <a href="#verificationMethod"><code>verificationMethod</code> section</a>,
                it does not need the <code>key_admin</code> privilege. A real example would be when an existing device with a
                key in the DID doc gets damaged and the identity owner has no plans to replace it.
            </dd>

            <dt><dfn>se_admin</dfn></dt>
            <dd><p>The holder of this privilege can add or remove items from a peer DID doc's <a href="#service">

            <dd><p>The holder of this privilege can add or remove rules from a peer DID doc's <code>authorization.rules
            </code> list. Typically this privilege is held only by very privileged keys, or by combinations of keys.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><dfn>rotate</dfn></dt>
            <dd>The holder of this privilege can replace its associated key definition, and all references to that
                key throughout a DID doc, with a new key definition and references, in a single delete-and-add
                operation. If key #2 has this privilege and exercises it, the result is that key #2 is revoked from
                the doc, but a new key (perhaps key #7) appears with exactly the same profile. This privilege is
                assumed to be held by all keys unless rules specify otherwise. The construct <code>revoke-implicit</code>
                is used to prevent keys from having implicit privileges. The example below shows that the key id
                <code>#H3C2AVvL</code> is unable to replace its associated key definition.

        <h3>Adding a rule</h3>

        <p>Notice that rules have <code>id</code> properties. The IDs for these rules can be assigned by any convenient
            method that provides collision resistance across concurrent updates.
        </p>
        <p>These <code>id</code>s give rules the same <a>CRDT</a> semantics as keys
            and service endpoints&mdash;they can be added or removed with deltas, but never modified. A <a>change
            fragment</a> that adds a new rule might be:
        </p>

        <pre class="example" title="Change fragment that adds a new rule">

    "authorization": {
        "rules": [

                "when": {"roles": "cloud"},
                "id": "rule-7"
            }
        ]
    }
}
        </pre>
        <p class="note">Both adding and deleting a rule must be authorized by a key with the <a>rule_admin</a> privilege.
            Care should be taken to bundle additions and deletions of rules in such a way that once a full <a>delta</a>
            is applied, the new state provides adequate privileges for all existing keys.
